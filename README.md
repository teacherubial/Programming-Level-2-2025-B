# Programming Level 1/2

Author: Tim Ubial

## Contents

This repository contains code that we did during Programming Level 1/2 in Grade 10.

Most of the code is in Swift and the main framework that we used in the class is SwiftUI.

This also contains the app that I developed. You can find it in the **Hab.it** folder.

My slide deck is also included, which I pitched during the *Final Showcase* in June 2025.

## Context

I learned Swift this semester. I didn't know very much about it. Throughout the term, I learned how to put together a really cool wireframe in Keynote. Then, I took a chance and learned how to translate the ideas from the Keynote to an actual app using SwiftUI and Swift.
